# Sparkiott

This application will provide profile access and simple hotel lookup functionality for a premiere hotel chain called "Sparkiott".

It was developed using Ruby 2.3.1 using the Rails 5.0.4 framework. It uses a PostgreSQL database and is deployed on Heroku.

The test suite uses Rspec 3.54.

MVP:

As a non-logged in user, I can:
1. register and get my new Sparkiott member number.
2. log in

As a logged-in user, I can:
1. log out
2. see my profile
3. see a list of hotels, by city
4. change my favorite hotel in my profile

As an administrator, I can:
1. add a new hotel
2. update a user's point balance
